  <d-title>
    <p>Recently, a link between the SIR compartmental epidemic model and Hawkes-like processes was found. This opens up the possibility to use some of the rich theory related to Hawkes processes when analyzing spreads of diseases using the SIR model. As the SIR model is not capable of modeling latent periods – a feature inherent in many diseases including Covid-19 – there is a need to extend the recently found link to more complex compartmental epidemic models such as the SEIR model. We have discovered this link and present it briefly in this blog post. For a detailed derivation of our results and a more in-depth discussion please refer to <d-cite bibtex-key="karakas"></d-cite>.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Since their introduction in the 1970s, Hawkes processes have been successfully applied in many different fields,
      including seismology, finance, and information science. Alan G. Hawkes also considered his class of stochastic
      processes "a possible epidemic model in large populations"<d-cite bibtex-key="hawkes"></d-cite>.</p>
    <p>
      However, a model assuming an infinitely large population is often not suitable when modeling the spread of
      diseases. That is why many researchers preferred compartmental epidemic models (such as the SIR or SEIR model) to
      Hawkes processes.</p>
    <p>
      Only recently, it has been shown that there is a link between Hawkes-like processes and the SIR compartmental
      model. As Rizoiu et al. put it, "[t]his is significant, as it indicates that tools developed for one approach can
      be applied to the other."<d-cite bibtex-key="rizoiu"></d-cite> However, this link is restricted to the SIR
      compartmental model. As this model lacks the capability to model a latent period, many researchers turn to more
      complex models such as the SEIR model and variants thereof. This is especially true for diffusion analyses in the
      current Covid-19 crisis.</p>
    <p>
      We have discovered a link between the SEIR model and Hawkes-like processes.<d-cite bibtex-key="karakas"></d-cite>
      In this blog post, we explain it briefly and give an overview of all the models mentioned so far.</p>
    <p>
      But before we dive into the theory, let&apos;s get a feel of the models we will talk about. The following plot shows
      four subplots, each containing the total number of infections (y-axis) that occured until a certain day (x-axis)
      in a population of 10 thousand people using one specific simulation model. When you hover over the bars, you will
      notice that many infection counts are not integers; that is because they are calculated as the mean of many
      simulations. Experiment with the sliders below the plot and see how they affect the spread of a disease.</p>

    <p class="important">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-flash"></span> <span class="info-box-start">Important:</span> The subplots on the
      left and on the right are <em>very</em> different! Also note, that you can adjust the latency in the models
      plotted on the right (higher values for $\sigma$ implying less latency). The models on the left, however, are not
      capable of modeling latency<d-footnote>In epidemiology there are two important latency-related time spans. The
      <em>latent period</em> is defined as the
      "[t]ime period between infection and onset of infectiousness"<d-cite bibtex-key="vynnycky"></d-cite>,
      whereas the <em>incubation period</em> is
      "[t]he time period between infection and onset of clinical symptoms"<d-cite bibtex-key="vynnycky"></d-cite>.
      So while the latent period and the incubation period are related, they are not necessarily the same. As our goal
      is to model the spread of a disease, we are more interested in the latent period than the incubation
      period.</d-footnote>, which is inherent in many diseases. This
      underlines the importance of extending the link found by Rizoiu et al. to other compartmental models.</p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-2" id="section-2"><span>2</span></a>
    <h2>Hawkes Processes</h2>
    <p>
      A Hawkes process is a type of counting process. A counting process counts events. These events can, for example,
      be infections (in epidemiology) or earthquakes (in seismology). Whenever an event occurs, the counting process
      experiences a jump of size $1$. Let&apos;s have a look at a sample path of a Hawkes process $N_t$ in the following
      figure (the blue line).</p>
    <p>
      <img src="img/hawkes_sample_path_with_conditional_intensity.svg" alt="sample Hawkes process with conditional intensity" /></p>
    <p>
      You will notice that its jumps are not evenly distributed over the observed time interval $[0, 60]$.
      Why is that?</p>
    <p>
      It&apos;s because the behavior of $N_t$ is dictated by its so-called conditional intensity $\lambda_t$ (the orange
        line). Whenever $\lambda_t$ is high we have a high probability of events. A low $\lambda_t$, on the other hand,
        leads to fewer jumps in $N_t$. This property is valid for all counting processes.</p>
    <p>
      What makes Hawkes processes so special is that their conditional intensity $\lambda_t$ again depends on the
      counting process. In the figure above we see that the jumps in $N_t$ also increase the conditional intensity.</p>
    <p>
      In general, the conditional intensity of a Hawkes process
      <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/HawkesProcess.html">has the form</a>
      \begin{align}
      \lambda_t
      = \mu(t) + \sum\limits_{t_j &lt; t} \nu(t-t_j)
      ,
      \end{align}
      where $t_j$ is an event time and $\mu(t)$ as well as $\nu(t-t_j)$ are both $\geq 0$.
      We call $\mu(t)$ the <em>background intensity</em>. It is independent of $N_t$.</p>

    <p>$\nu(t - t_j)$, on the other hand, depends on $t_j$ and thus on the history of the counting process $N_t$. We
      call $\nu$ the <em>kernel</em> of the Hawkes process.</p>

    <p>
      In the figure above, $\mu(t) = \mu$ was constant and $\nu$ was an exponential kernel, this means
      \begin{align} \label{exphawkes}
      \lambda_t
      = \mu
      +
      \sum\limits_{t_j < t} \kappa \theta \text{e}^{-\theta (t - t_j)}.
      \end{align}</p>

    <p>Here, $\kappa$ is called the <em>scale</em> parameter and $\theta$ is called the <em>decay</em> parameter. You
      may notice that this kernel equals the density of the exponential distribution with parameter $\theta$ scaled by
      the parameter $\kappa$.</p>

    <p class="important">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-flash"></span> <span class="info-box-start">Important:</span>
      The exponential kernel leads to immediate jumps in $\lambda_t$ when an
      event occurs. When modeling infections, this means that an infection immediately increases the
      probability of further infections. This also means, that there is no way of taking a latent period into
      account.</p>

    <p>
      We will address this issue below. But first, let&apos;s head to the other class of models we discuss in this
      post.</p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3" id="section-3"><span>3</span></a>
    <h2>Compartmental Epidemic Models</h2>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.1" id="section-3.1"><span>3.1</span></a>
    <h3>The SIR Model</h3>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.1.1" id="section-3.1.1"><span>3.1.1</span></a>
    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>Compartmental epidemic models (such as SIR and SEIR) model the spread of a disease within some population of size
      $N$ by dividing this population into groups (so-called compartments). In the SIR model these groups are called</p>
    <ul>
      <li>S (group of all <em>susceptibles</em>),</li>
      <li>I (group of all <em>infected</em>), and</li>
      <li>R (group of all <em>recovered</em>).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Susceptibles are healthy. After becoming infected, they move to compartment I. After some time infected people
      recover from a disease and hence move to compartment R. The possible transitions between compartments are outlined
      in the following figure.</p>

    <p><img src="img/flowcharts/sir.svg" alt="SIR model"></p>

    <p>
      The exact laws that govern the rates at wich people transition from one compartment to the next can be expressed
      in various ways. In the so-called <em>Continuous Time Markov Chain SIR</em> (CTMC-SIR) model this is achieved via
      <em>infinitesimal transition probabilities</em>. These probabilities govern the three stochastic processes $S_t$,
      $I_t$ and $R_t$, which represent the number of people in the respective compartment at time $t$.</p>

    <div id="info-box-probabilities" class="collapsible l-middle"><h5>A closer look at the CTMC-SIR Model</h5> <div class="collapsible-indicator"></div></div>
      <div class="content l-middle">
        <p>
          It turns out that it suffices to model only two of the three stochastic processes we have just defined.<!--, as the
          third can be reconstructed using the other two.-->
          Furthermore, we can focus on counting processes. $R_t$ is a counting process, counting the recovery events.
          $C_t \coloneqq I_t + R_t$ is also a counting process, counting the infections that took place until time
          $t$. Using these two processes, we can always reconstruct the two processes $S_t = N - C_t$ and
          $I_t = C_t - R_t$.</p>
        <p>
          According to Allen<d-cite bibtex-key="allen"></d-cite>, the CTMC-SIR model is characterized by the
          equations</p>
        <p>
          \begin{align}
            p_{(c+1, r), (c, r)}(\Delta t) &= \beta \frac{S_t}{N} I_t \Delta t + o(\Delta t) \text{ and} \label{eq:p-infection}\\
            p_{(c, r+1), (c, r)}(\Delta t) &= \gamma I_t \Delta t + o(\Delta t) \label{eq:p-recovery}\\
            \label{eq:p-stay}
          \end{align}
          where $p_{(c+j, r+k), (c, r)}(\Delta t)$ is short hand for
          \begin{align}\label{eq:sir-p-abbrev}
             \mathbb{P}((C_{t+\Delta t}, R_{t+\Delta t}) = (c+j, r+k) | (C_t, R_t) = (c, r)).
          \end{align}
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that the equations \eqref{eq:p-infection} and \eqref{eq:p-recovery} give the probabilities of an
          infection and a recovery within a short period of time, respectively. The probability that neither an
          infection nor a recovery happens within a period of length $\Delta t$ is
          $1 - p_{(c+1, r), (c, r)}(\Delta t) - p_{(c, r+1), (c, r)}(\Delta t)$.</p>
        <p>
          As $C_t$ and $R_t$ are counting processes, they have a conditional intensity. According to
          Aalen et al.<d-cite bibtex-key="aalen"></d-cite> the conditional intensity of a counting process $N_t$ is
          defined as
          \begin{align}\label{eq:la-as-lim-p}
            \lambda_t = \lim\limits_{\Delta t \downarrow 0} \frac{\mathbb{P}[N_{t + \Delta t} = N_t + 1 | \mathcal{F}_t]}{\Delta t},
          \end{align}
          where $\mathcal{F}_t$ is the history of the process $N_t$.
          Hence, we can easily obtain the conditional intensity of the processes $C_t$ and $R_t$. It is
          $\beta \frac{S_t}{N} I_t$ and $\gamma I_t$, respectively.
          </p>
      </div>

    <p>
      Having defined $S_t$, $I_t$ and $R_t$, we are now able to establish a link between the SIR model and Hawkes
      processes by finding similarities in their conditional intensities.</p>



    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.1.2" id="section-3.1.2"><span>3.1.2</span></a>
    <h4>The link to Hawkes processes</h4>

    <p>
      How does a conditional intensity look like in the SIR model? This depends on which process in this model we are
      considering. As we are interested in infections we might be tempted to choose the process $I_t$. However, $I_t$ is
      not a counting process, so we cannot compute a conditional intensity. (A counting process counts and thus, it is

      monotonically increasing, but $I_t$ decreases when people transition from I to R.)</p>

    <p>
      We can solve this issue by choosing the process $I_t + R_t$. This represents a counting process, which counts all
      infections that have occurred until time $t$. We have derived its conditional intensity
      $\lambda_t^{SIR} = \beta \frac{S_t}{N} I_t$ in the <a href="#info-box-probabilities">info box above</a>.</p>

    <p>
      Unfortunately, this result is not directly comparable to the conditional intensity of a Hawkes process. This is
      because a Hawkes process can only model infections, whereas the SIR model also contains recoveries as events.
      Therefore, Rizoiu et al. calculated an expected value, integrating over the recovery times, which are not
      observable in the Hawkes process. If we call the set of all recovery times $\mathcal{T}$, then the main result of
      Rizoiu et al. is
      \begin{align} \label{sirhawkesn}
      \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{T}} \left(  \lambda_t^{SIR} \right)
      = \left( 1 - \frac{I_t + R_t}{N} \right)
      \sum\limits_{t_j &lt; t} \beta \text{e}^{-\gamma (t - t_j)},
      \end{align}
      where $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are the parameters of the SIR model. (They also show up in the infinitesimal transition
      probabilities of the model as shown in the <a href="#info-box-probabilities">info box above</a>.) $\beta$ is
      governing the rate at which infections take place, whereas $\gamma$ determines how fast people recover.</p>

    <p>
      Now this looks pretty much like the conditional intensity of a Hawkes process with exponential kernel! To see this
      more easily, just set $\mu = 0$,
      \begin{align}\label{eq:translate-beta}
      \kappa \theta = \beta,
      \end{align}
      and
      \begin{align}\label{eq:translate-gamma}
      \theta = \gamma
      \end{align}
      in equation $\eqref{exphawkes}$ and compare it to $\eqref{sirhawkesn}$.
      Now the only difference is the factor in front of the sum!</p>

    <p>
      To eliminate this last difference between the two models, Rizoiu et al. defined the HawkesN process. This process
      is defined by its conditional intensity, which is the same as that of a Hawkes process, but without the background
      intensity $\mu(t)$ and with the additional factor $(1-N_t/N)$, where $N_t$ denotes the HawkesN process at time

    $t$. So compared to a Hawkes process, the HawkesN process lacks the parameter $\mu(t)$, but features the
    additional parameter $N$, which can be interpreted as the population&apos;s size.</p>

    <p>
      This additional factor in the conditional intensity – let&apos;s call it <em>HawkesN factor</em> – has an
      important effect. As is the case with the Hawkes process, infections tend to increase the conditional intensity of
      the HawkesN process. However, as the number of events rises, this increasing effect declines for the HawkesN
      process and eventually, further events can even have a decreasing effect, since the factor in front of the sum
      decreases.</p>

    <p>
      With diseases we make similar observations. At first, infections increase the probability of further infections.
      However, as more and more people become infected, the number of susceptibles declines and this lowers the
      probability of further infections, as there are fewer people left who can become infected.</p>

      parameters in one model and then make predictions using the
      other model.

    <h3>The SEIR Model</h3>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.2.1" id="section-3.2.1"><span>3.2.1</span></a>
    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      The SEIR model is a generalization of the SIR model, adding a compartment between S and I. This compartment is
      called E, which stands for <em>exposed</em>. Members of this group are infected, but are not able to infect others
      yet. After some time, people move on to compartment I, which means that they become infectious. The states and
      possible transitions are summarized in the following figure.</p>

    <p><img src="./img/flowcharts/seir.svg" alt="SEIR model"></p>

    <p>
      The additional compartment allows for modeling a latent period – a key characteristic of many infectious
      diseases. The duration of the latent period – that is the time a person spends in compartment E – depends on the
      incubation rate $\sigma$. The lower the value of $\sigma$, the longer the latent period. You can see this effect in
      the <a href="#altair-viz-7ba8f47b3ebf43d884e9beeb63885233">interactive chart above</a>; just move the slider for
      $\sigma$ and see what happens.</p>

    <a class="marker" href="#section-3.2.2" id="section-3.2.2"><span>3.2.2</span></a>
    <h4>The link to Hawkes processes</h4>

    <p>
      We have found that the SEIR model also has a close relationship to the HawkesN process. However, for the expectation
      of the conditional intensity $\lambda_t^{SEIR}$ to match that of a HawkesN process, the kernel of the HawkesN process
      must not be the exponential kernel, but rather the <em>hypoexponential</em> kernel or the <em>Erlang</em> kernel. The
      conditional intensity with a hypoexponential kernel looks like
      \begin{align}
      \lambda_t
      = \left(
          1 - \frac{N_t}{N}
        \right)
        \sum_{t_j &lt; t}
          \kappa \frac{\theta \sigma}{\theta - \sigma}
          \left(
            \text{e}^{-\sigma (t-t_j)} - \text{e}^{-\theta (t-t_j)}
          \right),
      \end{align}
      where everything that follows the scale parameter $\kappa$ is the density of a hypoexponential distribution.</p>

    <p>
      You may notice that in case of $\sigma = \theta$ this formula does not work, as we would divide by zero. We
      have shown that in this case the link between SEIR and HawkesN is established with the Erlang kernel, which leads to
      the conditional intensity
      \begin{align}
      \lambda_t
      = \left(
          1 - \frac{N_t}{N}
        \right)
        \sum_{t_j &lt; t}
          \kappa \theta^2
          (t-t_j)
          \text{e}^{-\theta (t-t_j)}
      .
      \end{align}</p>

    <p>
      How do these formulas differ from the conditional intensity with an exponential kernel? Have a look at the
      following chart. You can select a sequence of event times below the chart and the plot will update accordingly.

    <p>
      We can see that a high value of the parameter $\sigma$ leads to a conditional intensity that resembles that with
      an exponential kernel. That is because the hypoexponential kernel converges to the exponential one – a property
      inherited from the densities of the hypoexponential and the exponential distribution:
    \begin{align}
    \lim_{\sigma \to \infty}
    \frac{\theta \sigma}{\theta - \sigma}
        \left(
          \text{e}^{-\sigma (t-t_j)} - \text{e}^{-\theta (t-t_j)}
        \right)
    = \theta \text{e}^{-\theta (t - t_j)}.
    \end{align}</p>
    <p>
      The same relationship exists between the SEIR model and the SIR model. When $\sigma$ goes to infinity, the time
    spent in compartment E goes to zero, thus eliminating the need for this compartment.</p>

    <p>
      Now, let&apos;s have a look at smaller values of $\sigma$. They lead to a large delay with which the conditional
      intensity increases. In the SEIR model a lower $\sigma$ means that people spend more time in compartment E where
      they are not yet able to infect others. Thus, an infection does not immediately increase the probability of
      further infections but only does so with some delay.</p>

    <p>
      If we select the event sequence $\{0, 1, 2, \ldots, 9\}$ below the chart, we can see that the conditional
      intensity drops to zero at $t=9$. This is because in this example we assumed a population of only ten people.
      At $t=9$, the $10^{\text{th}}$ event occurs, so the HawkesN factor in the conditional intensity becomes
      $(1 - 10 / 10) = 0$.</p>
    <p>
      In an S(E)IR model, this $10^{\text{th}}$ infection event has the same effect. As soon as everybody left the
      group of susceptibles, there is nobody left who can get infected.</p>

    <p>
      The event sequence with ten events nicely reflects how infections can have an increasing effect on the
      conditional intensity at first. However, we can also see that the last two events decrease $\lambda_t$ – just as
      discussed above when we defined the HawkesN factor. Note that this decreasing effect eventually prevails
      irrespective of the kernel function used.</p>

    <p class="note">
      <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-info-sign"></span> <span class="info-box-start">Note:</span> The link between the
      SEIR model and HawkesN processes can be used in the same way as the link found by Rizoiu et al., which means that
      the equations \eqref{eq:translate-beta} and \eqref{eq:translate-gamma} remain valid.

    <h2>Summary &amp; Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      In this blog post we have briefly presented the link between the SEIR model and Hawkes processes, which can be
      seen as a generalization of Rizoiu et al.&apos;s work. This means, that now this link can be used when modeling
      diseases that feature a latent period, during which infected people are not infectious.</p>

    <p>
      This, however, does not imply that the SEIR model is suitable for every disease and one has to keep in mind that
      the latent period is not necessarily the same as the incubation period. This distinction is crucial for many
      diseases (e.g., Covid-19) and can complicate the the application of the SEIR model.</p>

    <p>
      Nonetheless, even in the case of Covid-19 there are works showing the application of the SEIR model. To this end,
      sometimes the model is adapted. One such adjustment can be the incorporation of quarantine measures.</p>

    <p>
     Further generalizations of the link between SEIR and HawkesN are possible and we will continue our research on this
     topic in order to offer tools related to Hawkes-processes to a wider range of compartmental epidemic models.</p>
