 abstract = {In recent years methods of data analysis for point processes have received some attention, for example, by Cox & Lewis (1966) and Lewis (1964). In particular Bartlett (1963 a,b) has introduced methods of analysis based on the point spectrum. Theoretical models are relatively sparse. In this paper the theoretical properties of a class of processes with particular reference to the point spectrum or corresponding covariance density functions are discussed. A particular result is a self-exciting process with the same second-order properties as a certain doubly stochastic process. These are not distinguishable by methods of data analysis based on these properties.},

abstract="A brief introduction to the formulation of various types of stochastic epidemic models is presented based on the well-known deterministic SIS and SIR epidemic models. Three different types of stochastic model formulations are discussed: discrete time Markov chain, continuous time Markov chain and stochastic differential equations. Properties unique to the stochastic models are presented: probability of disease extinction, probability of disease outbreak, quasistationary probability distribution, final size distribution, and expected duration of an epidemic. The chapter ends with a discussion of two stochastic formulations that cannot be directly related to the SIS and SIR epidemic models. They are discrete time Markov chain formulations applied in the study of epidemics within households (chain binomial models) and in the prediction of the initial spread of an epidemic (branching processes).",
